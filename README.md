# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Breast Cancer Detection via Supervised Learning

Hey thereðŸ‘‹ I see you're curious, just like me!

I'm Gowtham Data Scientist. Join me in this journey of problem-solving and potentially life-saving!

In this project, we are given the responsibility of accurately and automatically detecting cancer using machine learning tools!

We have a dataset 'Breast_cancer_dataset.csv' containing features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, and labels of 'Benign' or 'Malignant'.

Our job is to create a machine learning model that will classify the sample as cancerous or not, given the sample's feature values.
