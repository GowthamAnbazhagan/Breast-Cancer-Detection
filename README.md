# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Breast Cancer Detection via Supervised Learning

Hey thereðŸ‘‹ I see you're curious, just like me!

I'm Gowtham Data Scientist. Join me in this journey of problem-solving and potentially life-saving!

In this project, we are given the responsibility of accurately and automatically detecting cancer using machine learning tools!

We have a dataset 'Breast_cancer_dataset.csv' containing features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, and labels of 'Benign' or 'Malignant'.

Pandas Profiling is an automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool in Python that generates an interactive HTML report summarizing a dataset. It provides:

Overview: dataset shape, column types, missing values count.

Descriptive statistics: mean, median, min, max, standard deviation for numeric columns.

Value distributions: histograms, frequency tables for categorical features.

Correlations: Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, and high-correlation warnings.

Missing value patterns: visualizations of NaN distributions.

Duplicate detection: percentage and location of duplicate rows.

Our job is to create a machine learning model that will classify the sample as cancerous or not, given the sample's feature values.
